1. What was the Problem?

 -- Malaria is a deadly, infectious mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. With regular manual diagnosis of blood smears, it is an intensive manual process requiring proper expertise in classifying and counting the parasitized and uninfected cells. Typically this may not scale 
well and might cause problems if we do not have the right expertise.


2. Algorithm and Dataset

 -- Algorithm : Convolutional Neural Network \n
 -- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

3. RESULT

 -- ACCURACY = 96%
 -- LOSS = .2%

4. Regularization

 -- We use L2  and dropout regularization to prevent over-fitting or a high variance we use something regularization. 

5. Discussions

    i) By  this project we have learnt the implementation of the optimization method and image processing. \n
    ii) With this project we can make a decision after giving input values from dataset someone has Malaria or not. \n
    iii) With  this project we can make the decision in which circumstances we will use which kinds of algorithm to solve this. \n
    iv) By completing this project we have learnt that which process will give us the best probable outcome with maximum accuracy. \n
    v) Finally the most important outcome without taking blood can predict someone has Malaria or not by his or her physical history.

6. Conclusion

Compared to other diagnostic techniques, there are many advantages to using the proposed optimization method. 
It avoids the problems associated with rapid methods, such as being species-specific and having high per-test costs, while retaining many of the traditional advantages of microscopy, viz. species differentiation, determination of parasite density, explicit diagnosis and low per-test costs. There are, however, many possible applications where it would be suitable, such as performing an initial assessment for validation in a clinical laboratory. It would also constitute a diagnostic aid for the increasing number of cases of imported malaria in traditionally malaria-free areas, where practitioners lack experience of the disease.
